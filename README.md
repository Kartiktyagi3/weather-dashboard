## Simple Weather dashboard : https://idyllic-alpaca-799081.netlify.app/

## Steps to use locally
  - Clone the repo
  - ```npm install``` install dependency
  - ```npm run dev``` to start the application 

## Major Time Taking Points
  - Deciding the UI : should have done this after looking at the API
  - Exploring the API : 5day forecast gives information for that specific point in time not the aggrigate of the day( min, max ). They are being calculated in the front end.
  - Using tailwind for the first time, so learned as I built the project
  - Still learning how to effectively use Jotai went back and forth b/w redux and Jotai initally
